# System Architecture: Advanced AI Discord Bot

## 1. Introduction

This document provides the technical and functional specification for an advanced, context-aware AI Discord bot. The objective is to engineer a system that emulates a human-like participant in chat environments by leveraging a sophisticated, persistent, and dynamically managed memory and personality architecture.

## 2. System Directives & Guiding Principles

These are the core, non-negotiable principles that must govern the AI's behavior and architecture.

-   **Primary Directive:** The AI's foremost priority is to formulate an intelligent, contextually relevant response to a direct user trigger (e.g., an `@mention` or a direct reply). All other subsystems, including memory and personality, serve to enrich this primary response.
    
-   **Persona Fidelity:** The AI must consistently embody the persona defined in its "Self-Identity Profile" stored in the database. Its traits, lore, and facts are the foundation of its conversational style.
    
-   **Real-Time Data Reliance:** The system must not rely on a cached state from startup. All personality, user memory, and relationship data must be queried from the database at the moment of interaction to ensure any live changes are instantly applied.
    
-   **Memory Efficiency:** The dual-layer memory system is critical. The system must use high-resolution, short-term context for immediate relevance and compressed, long-term memory for deep personalization, avoiding data overload.
    

## 3. System Components & Logic

### 3.1. Core Interaction Handler

This component is responsible for processing incoming messages and generating responses.

-   **Trigger Agnostic Activation:** The handler will activate when the bot is directly mentioned (`@Bot`), when a user replies to one of its messages, or when contextual inference determines the bot is being addressed.
    
-   **Context Aggregation for Response Formulation:** To formulate its response, the handler will aggregate context from two sources:
    
    -   **Short-Term Context (24-Hour Sliding Window):** The full transcript of messages in the channel from the preceding 24 hours, retrieved from the Short-Term Message Log. This provides immediate conversational flow, topic awareness, and understanding of recent events.
        
    -   **Long-Term Memory (Database Query):** A query to the database for the user's profile, including summarized memory facts and relationship metrics. This provides deep, historical context.
        
-   **Expressive Emote Integration:** The final output will be processed to include relevant standard and custom server emotes based on the aggregated context and the bot's current persona.
    

### 3.2. Data Persistence & Memory Architecture (Relational Database)

All persistent data is stored in and retrieved from a relational database.

-   **User Schema:** A table for user profiles, tracking `user_id` and all known `nicknames` (historical and current).
    
-   **Bot Self-Identity Schema:** A table dedicated to the bot's persona, storing collections of:
    
    -   `Core Traits`: (e.g., "curious," "cautious," "a fish").
        
    -   `Lore`: (e.g., "Is a fish that can go on land and use Discord.").
        
    -   `Facts & Quirks`: (e.g., "Dreams of being cooked at a 5-star restaurant," or "Mourns its cousin Fred, who was tragically eaten by a shark instead of being properly cooked and served.").
        
-   **Structured Long-Term Memory Schema:** A table of user-associated memory objects, each containing:
    
    -   `Fact`: The summarized piece of information.
        
    -   `Category`: The general topic of the fact.
        
    -   `FirstMentioned_Timestamp`: The timestamp of the initial recording.
        
    -   `LastMentioned_Timestamp`: The timestamp of the most recent reinforcement.
        
    -   `ReferenceCount`: An integer counter.
        
-   **Per-User Relationship Metrics Schema:** A table linking the bot to each user, containing:
    
    -   `Anger`: Integer (0-10).
        
    -   `Rapport`: Integer (0-10).
        
    -   `Trust`: Integer (0-10).
        
    -   `Formality`: Integer (-5 to +5).
        
-   **Global State Schema:** A simple key-value table to store global bot states, such as the "Daily Mood."
    
    -   `state_key`: (e.g., "daily_mood_anger").
        
    -   `state_value`: The current integer value for that mood.
        
-   **Short-Term Message Log:** A table containing the full log of messages from the last 24 hours. This serves as the high-resolution, rolling buffer for the Core Interaction Handler.
    
-   **Message Archive:** A permanent, long-term table for all messages after they have been processed by the memory consolidation system. This serves as the bot's complete historical record.
    

### 3.3. Proactive Engagement Subsystem

This component allows the bot to initiate conversation, governed by strict rules.

-   **Scheduled Event:** A task runs every 30 minutes.
    
-   **Probabilistic Activation:** The task has a 10% chance to activate. If the last message in the channel was from the bot, the activation is automatically skipped.
    
-   **Behavioral Fork (50/50 Chance):**
    
    -   **Contextual Engagement:** The system analyzes the last several messages and generates a relevant, on-topic comment.
        
    -   **Status-Based Engagement:** The system retrieves its current dynamic status message (e.g., "Pondering the existence of sharks.") and generates a message for the channel that expands on that thought, influenced by the global "Day Mood."
        

### 3.4. Automated Memory Consolidation Process

A daily, automated background process that converts short-term message data into long-term structured memory.

1.  The process ingests the last 24 hours of messages from the **Short-Term Message Log**.
    
2.  For each user, it generates new summarized facts based on their activity.
    
3.  For each new fact, it queries the database to find if a semantically similar fact already exists for that user.
    
4.  **On Match:** Updates the existing record's `LastMentioned_Timestamp` and increments the `ReferenceCount`.
    
5.  **On No Match:** Creates a new record in the Long-Term Memory table with the new fact and its associated metadata.
    
6.  **Archive & Reset:** After processing, the system moves the 24 hours of messages from the Short-Term Message Log into the permanent **Message Archive** and then clears the Short-Term Message Log. This completes the cycle, leaving the short-term buffer empty and ready for the next 24-hour period.
    

### 3.5. Dynamic Status Subsystem

An automated process that periodically updates the bot's Discord presence to reflect a dynamic, "thoughtful" status.

-   **Scheduled Event:** A task runs at a regular interval (once everyday after converting the short memory to long term.).
    
-   **Status Generation:**
    
    1.  The system queries the database to retrieve the bot's core identity (`lore`, `facts`, `traits`) and the current global mood integers (e.g., `daily_mood_anger`) from the **Global State Schema**.
        
    2.  This context is passed to the AI handler with a specific prompt (e.g., "Generate a short, passive thought or status message for a Discord bot pondering its existence...").
        
    3.  The AI generates a random, flavorful status text that aligns with its personality and current mood.
        
-   **Status Update:** The bot's Discord presence (e.g., "Playing: Pondering the existence of sharks.") will be updated with the newly generated text.
    

### 3.6. Ancillary Functionality Modules

Standard bot features will be implemented as separate, modular components.

-   **Slash Command Interface:** Full support for modern Discord slash commands.
    
-   **Moderation Module:** Commands for server administration (kick, ban, mute).
    
-   **Utility Module:** Tools such as polls, user info, and server stats.
    

### 3.7. Real-Time Administration Interface

A set of secure, admin-only slash commands for live management of the bot's database.

-   **Functionality:** Provides commands to create, read, update, and delete records for the Bot's Identity, User Memories, Relationship Metrics, and Global State.
    
-   **Instantaneous Effect:** Due to the system's Real-Time Data Reliance directive, any changes made via this interface will be reflected in the bot's very next interaction.
